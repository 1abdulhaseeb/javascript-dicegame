# Javascript Dice Game
I have used html, css, bootstrap and javascript to create this website. It's also responsive i.e., made for both desktop & mobile devices.

# Instruction
1. Choose player 1 or player 2 in your mind.
2. Press start game button.
3. The website will randomly roll the dice and display the result.
4. You will either lose/win or draw.
5. Click play again in case you want to play again.
